# Musical-Harmonies-App
This is the Musical Structure App for Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree! I put my own spin on this app by calling it the Musical Harmonies App. This app allows you to listen to Gospel, Pop, R&B, and Instrumental melodies.

## Being A Udacious Coder
For this app, I was required to use a Custom Adapter, Intents, OnClickListeners, Custom Class, and include 2-6 activities. My code was insired by [Udacity's Miwok App](https://github.com/alianza-clyne/Miwok-Lesson-4)

## Ready To View The Musical Harmonies App?
